How to compile the project:
Type 'make'

Example of how to run the project:
./oss -n 3 -s 2 -t 4 -i 0.6 -f log.txt -v

Outputs
- OSS will output a message each time a resource is allocated or released and then print available resources directly after.
- Workers will print what they are doing (requesting, releasing, making out-of-order requests).
- The process table and allocation matrix indices correspond with each other
  - e.g., the process at index 1 in the process table will be at index 1 in the allocation matrix

Verbose output mode
- To enable verbose mode add the -v flag.
- This will output all messages from OSS to the provided log file.
- If verbose mode is off (default) only allocation messages from OSS will be printed to the provided log file
  - all outputs will still be printed to the console

Generative AI used: ChatGPT
Prompts:
- Write a function that prints the allocation matrix in a formatted way
- there is a bug in my queue handler that is only allowing it to scan the first entry in the queue I want it to scan the entire queue
Summary:
- wrote the function properly alignment was off slightly
- fixed the queue handler portion
